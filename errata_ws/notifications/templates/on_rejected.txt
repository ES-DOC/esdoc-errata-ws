To Whom It May Concern,

This is an email from the Errata service.  Thank you for submitting a dataset errata proposal.

1.  A moderator has reviewed your proposal and we have to inform you that it has been REJECTED.  

2.  Your errata can still be viewed here but will be removed in due course:

    {{http_protocol}}://{{web_host}}/static/view.html?uid={{errata_uid}}

3.  The moderator who rejected your errata should have sent you an email of explanation.

4.  You are free to resubmit the errata once you have made any relevant changes that the moderator may have recommended.

Thank you for your errata submission.  Your efforts truly help to keep the dataset archive coherent.

Kind Regards,

The Errata team
